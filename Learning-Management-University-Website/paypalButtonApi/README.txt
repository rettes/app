The code basically generates a button to access the paypal API.

All you need to do is to copy-paste into wherever you want it on the site
and assign the price to $cost.


Use https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/ to log in to check the transactions. Accounts are below.


Sandbox accounts

Customer:
Email: G7T4-Customer@ESD.com
Password: 12345678

Business:
Email: sb-q8643903042@business.example.com
Password: A1-$l4HO


*Note: Right now, if you see the transaction details of the customer via "See More Activity"
	on the customer's account, you can see that the business type is labelled as "Flights".
	This can supposedly be changed on the business' owner's account but the paypal's
	sandbox environment is really messy and i can't figure out how to change it.
